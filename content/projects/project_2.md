title: "Solid Waste Observatory"
description: "A platform developed by Ipplan for the Mais Fortaleza urban-cleaning program. It originally offered daily waste-collection data and mapped collection and recycling drop-off points. Some features were later discontinued by the city administration, so the current site may not reflect the full scope of the original project."
